Hello! I am Evan Gibbs - a mathematics student at York College of Pennsylvania.
I am broadly interested in mathematical biology, geometry, and topology, and especially the intersection of these topics.

Current (and Prior) Research Projects:
1. Manifold Learning in Drosophila melanogaster
2. Discrete Modeling of an Aquaponics System
3. Random Walk Applications in Mathematical Ecology
4. Development of Stock and ETF Screening Application

Why do I do this? So I can afford enough money for fishing gear, plus math is cool.
