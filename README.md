Hello! I am Evan Gibbs - a mathematics student at York College of Pennsylvania.
I am interested in mathematical biology, and I want to use mathematics to both understand and better this world. In particular, I enjoy mathematical ecology, focusing on ties to conservation, managmement strategies, as well epidemiology.  I also enjoy learning various forms of pure mathematics including geometry, topology, analysis, and combinatorics. 

Current (and Prior) Research Projects and Interests:
1. Optimal Control for Dengue Prevention by Biological Mosquito Control (Current)
2. Manifold Learning in Drosophila melanogaster (Current)
3. Quadratic Form Representations of Integers via Theta Series (My Undergrad Thesis I am currently working on)
4. Discrete Modeling of an Aquaponics System (Prior)
5. Development of Stock and ETF Screening Application (Prior)

Why do I do this? So I can afford enough money for fishing gear, plus math and nature are cool.
