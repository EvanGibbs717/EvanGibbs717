Hello! I am Evan Gibbs - a mathematics student at York College of Pennsylvania.
I am broadly interested in mathematical biology, and I want to use mathematics to both understand and better this world. I also enjoy learning various forms of pure mathematics including geometry, topology, analysis, and combinatorics. 

Current (and Prior) Research Projects and Interests:
1. Manifold Learning in Drosophila melanogaster
2. Discrete Modeling of an Aquaponics System
3. Development of Stock and ETF Screening Application

Why do I do this? So I can afford enough money for fishing gear, plus math is cool.
