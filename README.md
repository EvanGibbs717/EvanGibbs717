Hello! I am Evan Gibbs - a mathematics student at York College of Pennsylvania.
I am interested in mathematical biology, and I want to use mathematics to both understand and better this world. In particular, I enjoy mathematical ecology, focusing on ties to conservation, managmement strategies, as well epidemiology.  I also enjoy learning various forms of pure mathematics including geometry, topology, analysis, and combinatorics. 

Current (and Prior) Research Projects and Interests:
1. Optimal Control for Dengue Prevention by Biological Mosquito Control
2. Manifold Learning in Drosophila melanogaster
3. Discrete Modeling of an Aquaponics System
4. Development of Stock and ETF Screening Application

Why do I do this? So I can afford enough money for fishing gear, plus math and nature are cool.
